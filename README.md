# ClearCast â€“ Intuitive Weather

A minimalist weather app for iOS.

I have generally found weather apps to have overcomplicated or unintuitive user interfaces;
while designing and developing ClearCast, I keep the following tenets in mind:

1. Most people want a weather app that is intuitive, rather than one that is feature-rich.
2. Weather data from the recent past is valuable.
